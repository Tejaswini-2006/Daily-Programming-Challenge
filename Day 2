//Problem : Find the Missing Number
//You are given an array arr containing n-1 distinct integers. The array consists of integers taken from the range 1 to n, meaning one integer is missing from this sequence. Your task is to find the missing integer.

//Input :
//An integer array arr of size n-1 where the elements are distinct and taken from the range 1 to n.
//Example : arr = [1, 2, 4, 5]

//Output :
//Return the missing integer from the array.
//Example: Missing number: 3



#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, i;
    printf("Enter value of n (total numbers should be 1 to n): ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    int arr[n - 1]; // array of size n-1
    printf("Enter %d numbers (from 1 to %d, with one missing):\n", n - 1, n);
    for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
    }

    // Formula for sum of first n natural numbers
    int total_sum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;

    // Calculate sum of entered array
    int arr_sum = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        arr_sum += arr[i];
    }

    // Missing number is difference
    int missing = total_sum - arr_sum;

    printf("Missing number is: %d\n", missing);

    return 0;
}

OUTPUT
Enter value of n (total numbers should be 1 to n): 10
Enter 9 numbers (from 1 to 10, with one missing):
9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 
Missing number is: 10
