Problem : LCM (Least Common Multiple) of Two Numbers
You are given two integers, N and M. Your task is to find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of these two numbers. The LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both N and M.

Input :
* Two integers N and M, where 1≤N,M≤109
* N = 4, M = 6

Output :
A single integer representing the Least Common Multiple of N and M.
Output: 12

OUTPUT
Enter two numbers: 4 6
LCM of 4 and 6 is 12
Enter two numbers: 5 10
LCM of 5 and 10 is 10
Enter two numbers: 7 3
LCM of 7 and 3 is 21
Enter two numbers: 1 987654321
LCM of 1 and 987654321 is 987654321
